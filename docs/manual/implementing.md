## Creating an Asset

To create a new MPlayable object navigate to the `Assets/Moona/Data/` directory in the Unity browser and right click. From the context menu select `Create Asset/Moona/MPlayable`. The newly created object will be selected and show up in the **Inspector** view.

## Adding Audio

To add sound to the object simply dra-and-drop an AudioClip into the inspector. If you add another AudioClip it will be added to the bottom of the playlist. To drag multiple clips at once, select the MPlayable asset, slect the little lock at the top right of the inspector to lock it's view, then navigate to your audioclips and select which ever clips you want to add, then simply drag them in together.

## Properties

The Inspector for MPlayable has multiple sections labeled "AudioProp", "SpatialProp", "AdvancedProp", "RtpcProp" and below it all the "Playlist View".

Each of these properties and their effect on the sound behaviour will be discussed in more detail in the following pages.
